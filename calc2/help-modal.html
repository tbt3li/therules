          <div class="summary-body">
            The art of stacking is all about getting the most gain for the smallest cost. This is relatively easy to do
            when you've just got guardsmen and specialists to worry about, but it becomes more nuaunced when you begin
            introducing the wide variety of mercenary and monster troops into the mix.
          </div>

          <div class="summary-body">
            A good stacking strategy will do a few things, but ultimately it needs to load your army such that your best
            troops survive for as many rounds as possible. There's a near-infinite number of ways to do this, and every
            one of them will do much better than selecting your strongest troops and throwing them at an epic
            (ahem...yeah, this was me in the early days).

          <div class="summary-body">
            This tool allows you to select all of the troop types you want to send, and set a base count that's used to
            determine the actual numbers. Click the <strong>Create Battle Plan</strong> button, and just copy the
            numbers into the game. But...<em>which</em>
            units should you select? If you've unlocked g8, does it make sense to layer in g7 and g6? Maybe g5? What
            about specialists, should you send them as well?

            Through my own analysis, I've found that the following strategy works best for me. This may vary depending
            on the troops you have access to, the various battle research and talents you've unlocked, and so on. But
            here's what works for me:
          </div>

          <div class="summary-body">
            <ol>
              <li>Select ONLY your best two guardsman tiers. I've got g8, so I'd select all g8 and g7 troops.</li>
              <li>
                Select ONLY the specialists of the same tier as your guardsmen. I only have s6, so I won't send any
                specialists.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select ONLY the monsters of the same tier as your guardsmen. I only have m7, I'll select all of those.
              </li>
              <li>Select ALL the mercenaries you have.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="summary-body">
            This strategy works because it keeps your allocation of leadership focused. A larger reference stack means
            you have more "health headroom" to fit larger squads of mercinaries and monsters that will survive until the
            end. You want a balance of "# of squads" and "strength of each squad", and this Top 2 strategy is the
            easiest way to strike this balance. It also lets you avoid training or reviving a geometrically increasing
            number of troops at the lower tiers -- if you have 4k g8 spearmen, that would translate 8k g7, 16k g6, 32k
            g5, and so on. That's a lot to manage, and it isn't very cost effective!
          </div>

          <div class="summary-body">
            Combining the above strategy with the <strong>Find it for me</strong> button will give you the strongest
            army you can possibly muster. Since the cost effectiveness increases as your army size increases, this can
            make a big difference in your overall cost per experience point calculation. Just be sure to plug in your
            actual leadership, authority, and dominance values so that the numbers are accurate. And don't be afraid
            to divide that number in half (and so on) if you're unable to train at the recommended level.

  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"> <h3 align="center">General Rules</h3>
	<strong>1.</strong> Be respectful towards other players.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>1.1</strong> No bullying or discrimination of any kind.</div><br>
	<strong>2.</strong> Keep discussion respectful.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>2.1</strong> Keep event and other chats free of spam.<br>
	<strong>2.2</strong> Moderators are allowed to moderate and hide any messages that are off-topic, confusing, or make it difficult for others to access important information. They also have the authority to remove players who do not follow the specific chat rules.</div><br>
	<strong>3.</strong> Follow the rules of the kingdom.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>3.1</strong> Violating kingdom rules may result in expulsion from the clan.</div><br>
	<strong>4.</strong> Any actions or words that could negatively affect the clan's reputation are prohibited and may lead to expulsion.<br><br>
	<strong>5.</strong> All players must regularly check the journal and clan chats for updates.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>5.1</strong> Players who do not respond to messages for more than 5 days while being online will be expelled from the clan.<br>
	<strong>5.2</strong> Players who are absent for more than 5 days without prior notice will also be expelled.</div><br>
	<strong>6.</strong> Players who build silver villages and do not wish others to occupy them must register their villages in the Silver Registration chat.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>6.1</strong> If a village is not registered, it is considered free for all clan members.<br>
	<strong>6.2</strong> If a player occupies another player's registered village, they must leave the village and compensate the original player for any resources taken.<br>
	<strong>6.3</strong> Do not register game-generated silver villages.</div><br>
	<strong>7.</strong> Players in the clan solely to collect resources without contributing will be expelled.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>Contributions include:</strong><br>
	<strong>7.1</strong> Sending resources and silver to clan buildings (no specified amounts; contribute as much as you can without harming your growth).<br>
	<strong>7.2</strong> Providing chests from crypts, citadels, arenas, etc.<br>
	<strong>7.3</strong> Assisting clanmates with resources and silver.</div><br>
	<strong>8.</strong> Players in the leadership team cannot be leaders or superiors in other clans, as being part of the leadership team means that our clan is your number one priority. This rule aims to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. Violating this rule may result in removal from the leadership team.<br><br>
	<strong>9.</strong> Players should keep their resources and silver within protected limits; otherwise, they risk becoming attractive targets for frequent attacks.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success"><br><h3 align="center">Ancient Treasure</h3>
	<strong>1.</strong> All vaults belong to the clan. Players do not earn personal points for raiding the vaults.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>1.1</strong> Only the leader, superiors, and officers are allowed to initiate raids.<br>
	<strong>1.2</strong> Players who initiate raids must post the attack report in the "Vault Attack Report" chat, including the name of the player whose vault was raided.<br>
	<strong>1.3</strong> Players who do not send the correct troops should expect to be removed from the raids.</div><br>
	<strong>2.</strong> Build your vault.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>2.1</strong> Register your vault by copying and pasting the coordinates in the "Vaults" chat.<br>
	<strong>2.2</strong> Players who fail to build their vaults for more than two consecutive times without a valid explanation may be demoted or removed from the clan.</div><br>
	<strong>3.</strong> All players should attack the tinmen.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>3.1</strong> There are currently no minimum point requirements, but all players are encouraged to participate and try to secure the chests for the clan.</div><br>
	<strong>4.</strong> Players must send only combat captains for optimal performance:<br>
	Examples are: Hercules, Beowulf, Skadi, Cleo, and Aydae.<br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	<strong>4.1</strong> Stror, Carter, Helen, and similar characters must not be used to attack the Tinman.</div><br>
	<text style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">*</text> Please follow for further updates and changes to these rules.
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary"> <br><h3 align="center">Players Ranking in [THE] Clan</h3>
	<strong>Superior: </strong><br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	Only players with active duties can hold this rank.<br><br>
	Examples of duties include: Diplomats, Buildings/Research, Recruiters, CP Run organizers, etc.<br><br>
	Exception: During the "Clash of Kingdoms" event, players who plan to hold banners may request to become Superiors for 24 hours, allowing them to kick their city out of the clan territory if needed. During this time, they are not allowed to interfere with any other clan duties, accept requests, kick players, or perform any other actions. If they break this rule, they will be immediately removed from the clan.<br><br>
	Note: <text style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">*</text>The rank is not based on the time spent in the clan.
	</div><br>
	<strong>Officer: </strong><br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	Players in this rank must have a strong understanding of the kingdom and clan rules, as well as the inner regulations regarding clan events (such as Ancient's Treasure, CP Run, etc.).<br><br>
	They should be able to replace Superiors when needed, in case the Superior is unavailable or decides to quit their duties. Officers must be able to register vault attack reports, send the correct troops and captains to raids and CP Runs, and control the raids they initiate, ensuring all players send the proper troops and captains. They must also ensure that points are allocated correctly.<br>
	</div><br>
	<strong>Veteran:</strong><br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	Players who know the clan and kingdom rules, as well as how to build and register the vault, but do not meet the other requirements for the Officer rank.</div><br>
	<strong>Soldier:</strong><br><div style="padding-left:30px;">
	This is the rank for new players who are still adjusting to the clan, as well as players who have broken clan rules and were temporarily demoted to this rank.</div><br><br>
